Ah, it's a Space Shooter style game, really simple,<br>
I used OpenGL for the Graphics and OpenAL for the sounds<br>
The libs i use for OpenGl i linked my self, but the OpenAL stuff<br>
I used vcpkg, and was my first time using it so i dont know how it works exactly<br>
(Must look like NPM but again, i just used the thing without recearch)
